1. Definitions

(a) “Application” refers to a sequence of instructions or statements
    written in machine code language, including object code (that is the
    product of a compiler), binary code (data using a two-symbol system)
    or an intermediate language (such as register transfer language).

(b) “Artifact” refers to a software application (in either binary or
    source code format), Model, and/or Source Code, in accordance with
    what is specified above as the “Licensed Artifact”.

(c) “Contribution” means any work, including any modifications or
    additions to an Artifact, that is intentionally submitted to
    Licensor for inclusion or incorporation in the Artifact directly or
    indirectly by the rights owner. For the purposes of this definition,
    “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
    communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including
    but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source
    code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed
    by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing,
    sharing and improving the Artifact, but excluding communication that
    is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the
    contributor as “Not a Contribution.”

(d) “Contributor” means Licensor or any other individual or legal entity
    that creates or owns a Contribution that is added to or incorporated
    into an Artifact or its Derivative.

(e) “Data” means a collection of information and/or content extracted

royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this paragraph) patent
license to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Artifact where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Artifact to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Artifact and/or a Contribution incorporated within the Artifact
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to You under this License in connection with the

Licensor and Contributor each have the right to grant the licenses
above.

Section III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION

4. Use-based Restrictions. The restrictions contained in the AMD
Responsible AI Use Policy set forth in Attachment A are mandatory Use-
based restrictions. Therefore You may not Use the Artifact in violation
of such restrictions. You may Use the Artifact only subject to this
License; if Section II is held unenforceable or inapplicable, this
Section III will continue to govern any use of the Artifact. You shall
require all of Your users who Use the Artifact or its Derivative
to comply with the terms and conditions of this License, including
those contained in this paragraph, and only for the Permitted Purpose.

5. The Output You Generate with a Model (as Artifact). Except as set
forth herein, Licensor claims no rights in the Output You generate. You
are accountable for the Output You generate and its subsequent uses. No
use of the Output may contravene any provision as stated in this
License.

6. Distribution and Redistribution. You may host for Third Party remote
access purposes (e.g. software-as-a-service), reproduce and distribute
copies of the Artifact or its Derivatives in any medium, with or without
modifications, provided that You meet the following conditions:

6.1.  Use-based restrictions in paragraph 4 MUST be included as a
      condition precedent to effect any type of legal agreement (e.g. a
      license) governing the use and/or distribution of the Artifact or
      its Derivatives, and You shall give such notice to any subsequent
      Third Party recipients;
6.2.  You shall give any Third Party recipients of the Artifact or its
      Derivatives a copy of this License;
6.3.  You shall cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files;

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions with
respect to paragraph 6.1., to govern the use, reproduction, or
Distribution of Your modifications, or for any Derivative, provided that
Your use, reproduction, and Distribution of the Artifact or its
Derivative otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
License. In other words, the Use-based restrictions in Attachment A form
the minimum set of terms for You to license to Third Parties any
Artifact or its Derivative, but You may add more restrictive terms if
You deem it necessary.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
to in writing, Licensor provides the Artifact (and each Contributor
provides its Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using the Artifact,
and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under

consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or out of the use or inability to use the Artifact (including
but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.

11. If any provision of this License is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall be unaffected thereby and
remain valid as if such provision had not been set forth herein.

12. Term and Termination. The term of this License will commence upon
the earlier of Your (a) acceptance of this License or (b) accessing the
Artifact; and will continue in full force and effect until terminated in
accordance with the terms and conditions herein. Licensor may terminate
this License if You are in breach of any term or condition of this
License. Upon termination of this License, all licenses granted to You
will terminate and You must promptly delete and cease use of the
Artifact. Sections 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 survive termination of
this License.
